Java version of CBBOC

The GitHub repository contains a complete Eclipse project. Either checkout via your favourite Git client 
or else download the zipfile ('Download ZIP' button, above), unzip and import into Eclipse via 
`File/Import.../Existing Projects into Workspace'.

Some example competitors to run can be found in the cbboc.examples package.

Alternatively, compiling and running these examples using javac/java from a command prompt is of course possible, 
provided you also include the jarfiles in the lib3rd directory on the classpath.
